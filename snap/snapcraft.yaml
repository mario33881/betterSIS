summary: The modern shell for SIS (the circuit simulator and optimizer)
description: |
  Bettersis, or bsis for short, is an **interactive shell**
  that allows you to **control SIS** (the tool for synthesis and optimization of sequential circuits)
  more easily than its default shell thanks to modern features such as:
  * command **autocompletion**
  * command **history**
  * command **suggestions**
  > **Disclaimer:** I'm not affiliated with the SIS developers in any way.
